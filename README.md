Classifier_comparisson:
Python code using scikit-learn to compare and visualize different classifiers and compute their ROC:
  - Toy dataset of moon-shaped random numbers
  - naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, ..., xgboost
  - matplotlib to illustrate decision boundaries based on predicted probabilities of classes
  - determines values for ROC curve
  - plots ROC-AUC (area under the curve)  

naiveBayes:
Classification with Naive Bayes on iris dataset:
  - GaussianNB()
  - Evaluation with accuracy_score and classification_report
